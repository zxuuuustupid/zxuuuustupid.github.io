Short Bio
-----
I am Zhixu Duan (段之续), an undergraduate at [**SMEE**](https://www.smee.uestc.edu.cn/) of [**UESTC**](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), major in **mechanical engineering**. Now researching in [**Center for System Reliability and Safety, China**](http://relialab.org/).    

**Just a beginner in many areas.** Feel free to ask me about anything you want to know.   Research interests include, but are not limited to, zero-shot/few-shot learning, transfer learning, and llm.
